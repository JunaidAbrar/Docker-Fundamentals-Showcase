# Docker Fundamentals Showcase

## Purpose

This repository, "Docker-Fundamentals-Showcase," serves as a comprehensive demonstration of my foundational skills in Docker. It documents my journey through essential Docker concepts and practices, showcasing my ability to:

1. Set up and use Docker on a Linux environment
2. Execute basic Docker commands for image and container management
3. Create custom Docker images using Dockerfiles
4. Run containers in various modes (single task, interactive, background)
5. Work with database containers and perform basic SQL operations
6. Push and pull images to/from Docker Hub
7. Set up and use a private Docker registry
8. Develop and containerize a simple web application
9. Migrate containers between machines

The contents of this repository reflect hands-on exercises covering Docker installation, image handling, container operations, Dockerfile creation, and practical application deployments. It demonstrates my understanding of Docker's core concepts and my ability to apply them in real-world scenarios.
